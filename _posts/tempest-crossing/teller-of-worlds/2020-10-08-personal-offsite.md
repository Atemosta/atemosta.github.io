# Day 57: Personal Offsite

Going to be a short daily, long day at work and my brain is about to ooze out of my ears >.>

Joined a Self-Development Zoom Meeting and the speaker was talking about personal offsite. Here are some slides I snagged with my camera :^) These uploaded backwards so uhhhhhh read from bottom to top I guess?

The more these days drag on, the more I realize how important it is to take care of your mental health. The idea of the quarterly personal offsite sounds amazing, and going offsite with up to 3 other people you immensely trust can break down a lot of the personal limitations we didn't know we had by allowing ourselves to be **vulnerable**. 

*Indigenous People's day is coming up, why not schedule an offsite on that day?*

:thinking: Hmm... why not indeed...
