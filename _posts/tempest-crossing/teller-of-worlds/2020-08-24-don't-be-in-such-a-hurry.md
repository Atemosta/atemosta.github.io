## Day 14 : Don't Be in Such a Hurry 
I'm not sure where I heard this phrase, whether I read it in some blog or if someone just happen to tell me this in passing, but the idea of not getting somewhere in time has been an ever-present fear welling inside me. Half of the attribution lies in the fact that I didn't really take anything seriously until I was already a quarter of a century old, and the other half lies in the fact that tomorrow is not guaranteed. Though letting my emotions drive the momentum and passion of my work is fantastic in its own rite, it's comes with the side-effect that I'm not always in the most rational state of mind when I am working on my craft, and simple mistakes start piling up until it becomes too frustrating to go on. My new pledge to myself is now to take a deep breath as often as possible, take stock of what's going on around me, and to not be in such a hurry to get to the next stop. 

*And with this post, I have successfully completed two weeks of dailies! I think I have hit a great of the thematic elements I resonate with most, and now I will try my hand at some parables to "show without telling" more thematic elements of the world of **Tempest Crossing.***
