## Pro2 Day 65: NaNoWriMo Part 1
**National Novel Writing Month**, or **NaNoWriMo** for short, is a non-profit organization which organizes a yearly event where writers are challenged to write 50,000 words in 30 days (around 1.667k words per day).  All money collected goes into supporting creative writing ventures all across the world, and the participants themselves get a glimpse into the life of an author.

I've known about this event for years (I used to be an avid reader as a kid until I got an Xbox 360 in high school :upside_down_face:), but I've never taken writing seriously due to a mix of "not having anything to say" mixed with not making time for creative hobbies Pre-Covid. After the Creative's Workshop experience (God bless that purple button discount :purple_circle:)... I believe my writing is a little more  serious and consistent now.

## Teller of Worlds
I signed up for **NaNoWriMo** and was immediately met with a flurry of questions regarding my participation:
* Who are you? What is your story?
* What do you want to write about?
* What **genre** will your project encompass?

Pre-Akimbo, I would have spent hours trying to formulate answers I felt were "worthy." 64 days in, and filled out everything I truly believed in myself in less than 15 minutes. Being decisive is a virtue I prize greatly now.

What is **Ousikai**? If **mtfallsVR** is my engineering persona, **Ousikai** **(欧思凯)** would be the other creative half. It was a named granted to me by my Intro to Mandarin teacher, and roughly translates to "*Having the Wisdom to Move Mountains*". It is not an actual name, just a hodge-podge of Mandarin characters based on my real name initials :joy:. But the beauty is there all the same. 
   

What is a **Teller of Worlds**? It is a self-imposed title to chronicle my experiences and interactions with others. It used to just be **Teller of World** when I was only focused on telling stories based on real experiences, but now that VR is added to the mix, I want to tell the stories of virtual worlds too. I derived the title from this song, which to this day I still have no idea what it is about :upside_down_face:.

This is going to be a rough undertaking for sure, but I'm all about the transformation journey. I'm looking forward to seeing who the Ousikai of 30+ days later will become.

## Bonus 2: The Eternal Creative's Hell
So I just took a look at the **NaNoWriMo** forums... something is eerily similar but I can't put my finger on it...
