## Pro2 Day 55: Burned Out on a Tuesday
> *I feel like Lil Baby because I'm tired of being tired of being tired.*
> - Tommy Ice in "*Keys to the Benz*"

On [Sunday](https://pro2.akimbo.com/t/oscar-k-sandoval-rivera-dailies-tempest-crossing-begins/27179/218?u=mtfallsvr) I felt extremely accomplished as I had finished a long week of tackling tasks. 

Come Monday I feel absolutely spent, it was such a struggle to get out of bed. 

Tuesday (today) did not fare much better... what was wrong? 

I took a look at Todoist (basically my crutch to free up mental space by organizing tasks I have to do), and look at the following data...

 ![90-tasks|368x165](upload://q3v4qDPUCbQ4VF15Vo24IP7c78b.png) 

The **number** at the end of each bar is the number of tasks completed in a week, 
**Grey** is unplanned tasks
**Blue** is Virtual Reality Development
**Green** is Chores
**Orange** is Writing (mostly the pro2 workshop)
**Red** is Social Obligations (planning my time to spend with friends and family)

My jaw almost dropped when I saw last week's statistics. *90 tasks, with probably over half on unplanned tasks? What the heck was I doing last week?* 

I've touched on this subject over a couple of dailies, but pre-Covid I felt like my life was going nowhere, and through a series of life-changing encounters, end up here. I'm doing more in the last 6 months than arguably the last 25 years of my life, and I like this feeling. *Accomplishment, fulfillment.* But I guess my body can't keep up anymore. I feel tired. And I'm tired of being tired of being fired. 

Before COVID I didn't have any friends I could lean on for this issue because I was arguably doing the best in the time-management space... today was different. I reached out to a friend who mentioned in passing about how efficient they are with their time. A simple message. 

"Hey Melissa, how do I join the 5AM club?"

I was expecting maybe a book, maybe a motivational video or two, but nopeeeeee. I got the ***works***. Apparently Melissa had been doing this from the age of 18-25, and pretty much had her routine cemented since then. I got SO much more than what I was expecting, and as an added bonus I got my own time-management coach in case I ever need a boost. [Huh, I guess this is what relying on reliable people is like](https://pro2.akimbo.com/t/oscar-k-sandoval-rivera-dailies-tempest-crossing-begins/27179/187?u=mtfallsvr). 

My two tasks for today:
* Figure out if the tasks for today are really important enough for today, or if they can wait. (Melissa: *This burned out Monday and Tuesday will mean nothing a  year from now, so why stress about it?*)
* Actually go to sleep at 9PM today so I can ~~try to~~ join the 5AM club tomorrow. No exceptions, I'm dropping everything. Nothing is so important that I sacrifice my sleep and health for it. It will have to wait until tomorrow. (Is this the alleged *balance* I've been avoiding?)

Curious to hear your run-ins with the 5AM club and it's various people of colorful personalities :grinning:
