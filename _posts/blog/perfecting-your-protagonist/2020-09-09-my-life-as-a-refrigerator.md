*And Miranda knows genre better than most.*

[fantasy world, and if you can’t avoid your death you will be forced to repeat it endlessly, or until your soul finally collapses]

[fantasy world, and you turn into an spooky skeleton hell-bent on destroying the human world, for no better reason than why not?]

[fantasy world, and you turn into an invincible blob that gains knowledge through absorption and creates racial equality through both an empathetic and forceful rule]

Coming Soon: My Life As A Refrigerator [a completely original idea by ME]
[the hero transforms into a refrigerator that can duplicate any food stored inside of itself, which causes a great war as opposing factions utilize everything they can to claim the legendary fridge for themselves]

Turns out you can literally go anywhere and be anything as long as your not on earth! What are some fun ideas you can churn out on the spot?
