*Preface: this is my series of RAW and UNEDITED daily posts for NaNoWriMo. It’s going to be extremely imperfect, lauden with grammatical and spelling errors, but brimming with potential. I post it mostly for myself, but invite any daring souls to try and keep up with the winds that blow me to tomorrow :wind_face:.*

# Day 99 (NaNoWriMo Part 20)     
## Oh, Kairos

I have a pretty lame middle name.

My parents both have middle names derived from their ancestors.

My younger sisters both have middle names after famous bible heroines.

Me? My middle name is Kevin. A name without meaning. There are no legendary figures named Kevin. My ancestory is El Salvadoran, are there are no Kevin in El Salvador. It is an exceedinly normal American name. I wondered why my name had the least amount of meaning and thought put into it. Maybe I had the least amount of meaning and thought put into myself.

Cursed with such an overbearingly average name, I truncated it. K is what my name appears on in official documation. Whenever anyone ask me what the K stars for, I say it stands for K. It it just a letter without meaning, a placeholder for a name that should have been, but never was.

I asked my mom why my middle name was Kevin. She told me she just liked the way the name sounded. It was the name of her roommate's boyfriend, and apparently that was enough to dictate my life over. She never even looked up what Kevin meant.

K is for King, the ruler of the land.

---

K is for Kirito, the mystic hero of the virtual world, augmented world, and artifial intelligence world.

---

K is for Kairos, the opportune moment for change. Here and now.
