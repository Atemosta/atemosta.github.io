*Preface: this is my series of RAW and UNEDITED daily posts for NaNoWriMo. It’s going to be extremely imperfect, lauden with grammatical and spelling errors, but brimming with potential. I post it mostly for myself, but invite any daring souls to try and keep up with the winds that blow me to tomorrow :wind_face:.*

# Day TBD (NaNoWriMo Part TBD)     
## Twice-Told Legend

---

I remember the first time I tried to do social VR. The most popular app at the time was VRTalk. Colorful and exciting videos of streamers meeting and chatting with strangers across the VR-verse flooded by MeTube inbox, and after perusing a couple of these enticing videos, I committed. It was time to get friendly, something I had been awful at as a lifetime skill. After downloading the app on my Retina Journey, walking through the movement tutorial, picking a short and adorable (dare I say, *kawaii?*) avatar to masqureada as, and joining the starter world... I was wholly overwhelmed and unimpressed. I remember a tall hotdog approaching me, demanding that I speak. I was taken aback, confused by this jolly wiener's aggressive tones, and when I reached the unmute button to speak, I froze. The voice that would come out, would not suit my avatar. I wasn't me here, I was someone else, someone way shorter and cuter. The desynchronzication between the me in the physical world and what could be me in the virtual world would be shattered. The hand I lifted return slowly and dejectedly towards my side. No longer waiting around for my obvious non-compliance, the giant hotdog scampered away to go harass another  nearby user.

Decicing that despite this souring first experience, I would go on. There would more worlds to explore, and more experiences to make. And that sentiment was the last sentiment of optmish I remmeber. 

The rest was awful.

As great as the Retina Journey was, it was still a phone processor inside of a wireless helmet, and could not process higher-end environments or multiple users in the same room, lest it overheat and crash. That limited the amount of worlds I could explore as they would have to be optimized to run for Retina Journey users, and no one wanted to optimize for us. We were the neweset kids on the block, and had very little to offer to a somewhat long-standing communitiy.

From the few worlds I was able to explore, if the performance wasn't dog-awful, the people were. It was mix of preteens and social awkwards emerging adults, shouting obscenes, reciting quotes from popular may-mays, changing into all manner of avatars for the pure prepubscent enjoyment of all spectators present (I vividly remember one preteen turning into a talking toilet. It was both hilarious and extremely unnerving). Disappointed in the clear lack of objection in this endlessly chaostic spaces, I closed VRTalk and turned off my headset for the day. I needed something real to wash down the aftertaste of tatking toilet out of my mind.

Weeks later, I decided to step into the arena once more. The Retina Journey app store noticed my interest in social VR after trying our VRTalk, and thus recommended to my VR home hub page: OtherSpace VR. Figuring why not, I downloaded the app, strapped in, and was met with... a confusing bunch of signs. I found myself on a penthouse suite, completee with rootops games, a lavishly furnished apartment, and even a basketball court. The buildings adjacent ot mine where highrises masking the obvously missing cityscape behind them. I pulled up the navigation menu, and the menu fed back to me: ***HOME***. I wondered what VR's facination was with creating extravanagnt spaces for the user's home world. Maybe it was the longing to have more somewhere than nowhere, and if we can't be wealthly in the physical world, the virtual world could make due as well. Rumminating over these fascinations, I found the door out of my penthouse suite. It was a giant portal, and it was laabeled as ***WORLD'S CROSSING***. I accepted the prompts to agree to enter another world, and soon found myself traveling to somewhere else.

Several somewhere elses later, and I had stumbled into a OtherSpace Creative Writing meetup. I had seen this weekly event pop into the featured event's tab time and time again, but always neglected to make time to join in. This week was different. I had cleared my entire afternoon, and was reading to go somwhere else once more. I remember thinking to myself, "Hah, this is going to be a riot. There is no way I will cry at a Creative Writing Meeting."

*“In 5 minutes, using only verbs and adjectives, how would you describe yourself?”*

Having my trusty pen and paper ready, I let the words flood the page, and stopped at the 5 minute mark to stare in complete shock at the aftermath of my brainstorm. The person I described myself to be, was nothing like the person I wanted to become nor the cheerful and pleasant persona others identified me as. Panic might have been the first emotion I could remember, because just the sheer amount of detetable and odious things I wrote about myself petrified me. Where the :dolphin: did all these emotions come from? Where was it all going wrong? Have I just been a fraud and a liar this whole time? What… is going to become of me?

But there something here, something writhing. Like an obligation I needed to commit to, but had forgotten until this very day. I was excited to even feel this way, it had been so long since something stimulated me to look so deeply within. I made mental commitment to return next week, there was more to my self-story to unfold


*“In 5 minutes, try to describe the first memory you can recall. Not in words, but just in feelings alone.”*

To be blunt, I can barely recall anything before my first year in the corporate world. What I originally shrugged off as something unimportant, made me slowly start to realize that I was oppressing something. But I had an amazing childhood free of dilemmas, what traumatic events could I possibly be running from?

And therein lies the issue.

Trying my absolute best to recall something from my past, I began to realize that I used to be… happy. All the earliest memories of my childhood felt simple, carefree, warm, and if I were to use a color to contain all these feelings, I would describe it as yellow. The further along the memories I traversed, the more of these childhood feelings began to fade away. A once prominent bright yellow began to lose it flare and slowly start to drip into sadder and sadder colors, transitioning from blue and eventually into gray, truly falling into the trope when something loses color in this world, it loses meaning. When I really paused to reflect on my mental recollection, I remembered last week’s prompt, and suddenly it all clicked.

I began to hate myself because I never allowed myself to fail, and became a miserable self-indulgent wreck because of it.

My childhood never challenged me, my parents said I was amazing, and whenever ANYTHING put me out of my comfort zone, I would immediately scurry back into a place where everything was okay. The more I ran from the chances to try something new and possibly fail, the more I began to miss out on life, and the more I began to feel empty inside. The worst part was, I didn’t even REALIZE I felt this way. Not until I took a deep breath and finally had a chance to take stock of what was silently falling apart around me.
