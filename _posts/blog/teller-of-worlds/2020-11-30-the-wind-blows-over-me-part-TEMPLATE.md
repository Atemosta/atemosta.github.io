*Preface: this is my series of RAW and UNEDITED daily posts for NaNoWriMo. It’s going to be extremely imperfect, lauden with grammatical and spelling errors, but brimming with potential. I post it mostly for myself, but invite any daring souls to try and keep up with the winds that blow me to tomorrow :wind_face:.*

# Day TBD (NaNoWriMo Part TBD)     
## TBD

Ethical considerations:
* What are the ethical, legal and regulatory issues of most consequence to our future? 
* How can we make sure we stay in control of our and our kids future in an ethical, fair, sustainable way? 
* Is humankind still evolving? If so, is there a moral or ethical component to our growth as a species? 
* Building resilient, supportive and sustainable communities?
