*Preface: this is my series of RAW and UNEDITED daily posts for NaNoWriMo. It’s going to be extremely imperfect, lauden with grammatical and spelling errors, but brimming with potential. I post it mostly for myself, but invite any daring souls to try and keep up with the winds that blow me to tomorrow :wind_face:.*

# Day 101 (NaNoWriMo Part 23)     
## Littlewood Town

### (Com)mander Mondays 
"*Welcome to the fold, commander, we've been waiting for someone like you.*"

"*Haha, very funny. You probably say that to all the new recruits, huh?*"

"*Well, you're not exactly wrong, but...*"

Every Monday I lead the new recruits into the grand world that is Guild Battles 2. It is a longstanding MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Play Game) that is arguably in its last stages of life.  I was first introduced into the game very late in its production lifecycle, and am probably one of the last "new" players the game is ever going to get. The only reason I can tell is that the developers of the game are getting slower and slower with updates. The fresh and flavorful seasonal events of old becaome routine and predictable when they add little to no addedums all subsequent years. The problems that plague customer support are still not automated away, despite being a easy problem to fix ( you need to go to customer support to change your email! this is 2020!). But despite all these tiny hiccups, I see a vision in this game not present in the vast many of the competitors on the market. This game has moral, community, and soul.

As it archetypal of most MMORPGs, you get a chance to select your gender, but the kicker is always how deep the game goes into letting you choose a race. Most races are pretty unimaginative (here are white humans, brown humans, humans with long ears, short humans!), some cater to the idea that alt-human races MUST be ugly (looking at your ogres), but Guild Battles 2 is different. They have a myriad of races that all exist in the global lore of the world, but you can only select 5 which are VERY distinct from one another and most MMORPGs in general. They have the humans... which are humans, plant people who are in tune with the earth, giants who are in tune with nature spirits, shorties which are in tune with technology, and cat people who are like the FOIL to humans suprisingly enough. Each race has its own lore and world, and even sub-factios that further intricate and complicate the races. But this is all baseline stuff which I'd argue is the minimal viable product for MMORPGS: where I think Guild Battles 2 stands out is how it insert non-normal things into a non-normal world. Two of the biggest things that is current almost unicorn in nature is represenation of disabled individuals and a promotion for same-sex relationships. 

Most people (myself included) don't really know how to treat our brothers and sisters who need a little more help to do what we consider normal. They are all treated differently by everyone, and they also react different as well. Some are constantly reminder of how they aren't normal by special treatment or discrimination, and what Guild Battles 2 pushes out is the ideal that you can be treated as normal and equal and that being treated as normal, should be normalized. Oscracization, whether intentional or accidental, is hugely detrimental to the human psyche as a naturally social species, and what I love about this game is that even if you are different or labeled as such, you can still be yourself to your highest caliber, be "useful" if not moreso than "normal people", and have a place to be accepted by others just like you.

The other aspect I enjoy is the normalization and forefront placement of same-sex relationships in the game. Though man-woman relationships are the society norm since the epoch of time, a new breed of identity is brewing in the latest millenia. People are identitfying themselves in ways that are normal to our traditional standards, and as they don't fit in, they stand out and are intentionally or otherwise treated differenly.
