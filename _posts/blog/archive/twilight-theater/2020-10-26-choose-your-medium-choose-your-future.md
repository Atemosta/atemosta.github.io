## BONUS: Choose your medium, choose your future
*Digging in here. It’s easy to be defensive, to reverse engineer a story that justifies the work you’ve sacrificed so much for over the years.*

*But just for a moment, start with a clean slate…*

*Why this medium? Why this path?*

*Is it in and of itself? The work you’re doing–does it fit into the category that those that experience this medium need it to?*

*What are the other paths you could take with your work to have it cause the desired impact?*
