They capture a richer, more true picture of what it means to be an American and we should all be interested in these stories. Much like the Truth and Reconciliation Committee in South Africa, we need to know the stories, the good, the bad and the ugly so that we can all have the same understanding of our shared history.

:heart: this answer. Corny as you may think it be, it is the corny that *needs*  to be.

I guess we simply need to re-write history : )

Bold words, Eli. Let's see if we can follow this through :)

Do you have a solution for your “who” and “how”?

You've forced my hand, Eli. Thanks for giving me a taste of my own medicine, you've inspired a whole new daily!

## Pro2 Day 42: The Who and How

Mine is a bit more abstract... I've touched on it through several dailies and prompt responses, but I'd love to say it again until I hammer the point home with myself.

> The "Who"

The first and most prominent audience I'd like to hit are emerging adults such as myself. This quote from fight club details exactly who I am looking for:

> I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables - slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war... Our great depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won't. We're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.

This movie came out 20 years ago, and the situation has only gotten worse as technology advances and will continue to get worse until creatives like us step and present creative solutions.

The second audience I'd like to broadcast to is my specific Latino community. After talking with my dad about his childhood, the entire history of El Salvador is just... heart-wrenching. If 40% national employment being the norm doesn't speak volumes, the sad history of being subject to exploitation from Western influences and never really being able to stand up for itself on the global stage just brings me to tears. It reminds me of the first audience I want to target: a group of people lauden with potential, but dragged down by the weight of exterior influences. 

> The "How"

I say this to @Chen on the regular since he seems to *love* questioning my prompt responses (:wink:) , but the intersection of genres I want to hit are these:

* isekai (a regular person becoming a hero)
* virtual reality (being able to step into the shoes of others and experience the world from their viewpoint)
* role-playing videogames (the power fantasy of being able to bend reality to your will)

Now take a step back and think about the lineal connections... what if I made a virtual reality role-playing videogame where you are a regular person who bends reality to become the hero they've always aspired to be?

What if you could step away from this experience, take some of the learnings, apply it to your real-life, and actually see positive change? 

*"If anyone can be a hero, why not me?"*

Admittedly, this a rather ambitious, lofty, and abstract goal, but through this workshop alone I know the work *will be done* if I commit to it everyday.
