## 29. Famous to the family
*What’s the point of being heard…*

> ***Prompt***: *Who are you here to serve?*

*Be precise about them. By name, perhaps, or job title. Or by the size of their record collections or how many concerts they attend. Consider what they spend or what they talk about or what they love. How will you make your work spreadable?*
