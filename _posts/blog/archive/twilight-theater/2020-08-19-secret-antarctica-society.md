## 5. What’s it all for? (What does it look like when it works?)
*What does it look like when it is successful…*

*It’s a lot easier to find your voice if you know where to look for it.*
*What exactly would it look like if you succeeded? How far do you need to go?*

***Prompt***: *There are ends and there are means. Is getting your book published or your song on the radio the point? Is it the end?*

*When it works, what will ‘it’ look like? What does a good day entail, specifically. Is it about acclaim, awareness, trust, income, respect, status, the process… What will you trade to get what you seek?*

*You came here because you want to produce a play or have a show in a gallery or publish a book. You want to be a professional being creative. But why?*

*If it works, what do you get?*

*If you could get that a different way, would you? Could you?*

*A good day?*
*A good month?*
*Why?*

*Tell us about it. Everything you do know and can see. We know these are tough questions. Messy and imperfect posts are encouraged.*

## A Quick Summary:

**Hobbies**: I have lots! But most revolve around competition because it's thrilling to see where you stand against opponents in the world. 

**Job**: I write code

**Career**: I (hopefully) write code for stuff that I feel is important to be developed

**Vocation**: ??? 

In terms of a divine calling, I've always had this weird notion as a kid that I should create a super secret society in a remote part of the world where no one could bother us. I would have a secret task force scattered and traveling across the world, searching for new potential candidates to be invited to my Secret Antarctica Society (the most remote place I could think of as a kid). We would develop a community where anyone could have any job, and we would always be helping one another because that's the right thing to do as neighbors. I wonder where this notion really came from? It's not like I had a terrible upbringing in the cookie cutter suburbs. Maybe just a tad too boring. 

Fast-forward 20 years later, and I still have this nagging feeling that I want to start my own community with similar intent. Reality hits a quite a bit harder now, and the obviously big limitation is how much funding can I procure and constantly generate when everyone is just doing whatever the heck they want! My Secret Antarctica Society has to take a bit of a lateral shift if it is still to become a reality, and now my dream is to become an entrepreneur who can self-fund himself through his creative crafts, and teach others to do the same thing so we can stop just existing and finally start living.

Wait a minute... this sounds just a bit like what Seth is doing right now, huh? :stuck_out_tongue:
