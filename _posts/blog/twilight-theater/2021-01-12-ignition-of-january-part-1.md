> *"You will become a hero."*

It is my destiny, it is my birthright, it it was I deserve simply for being here and being now. All the stories that have been spoken, all of the tales I have been told, their is only onle recourse for me: to be above and beyond all others as their savior. I want to to have their faith instilled in me, I want to have the weight of their world on my shoulders. I can do it all, I can handle anything and everything, it is my duty, and I will see this through

------

> *"You will never become anybody."*

Reality comes crashing through, and I laid in the gravel with my face scuffed across the granite grounding. I have falled yet again, and my old wound mesh with the new. Time and time again I try, and time and time again I fail to make it. As I lay here falling, my tears mix in with the blood from my ne wwounds, The clear streams of sorrow mix with the maroon waters of wounds, and my ision conitnues to blur. There are only three certainties in life, death, taxes, and this fate. I will never change, for it is now I that was chosen to become a hero.

-----

> *"Somehow, someday, I will become somebody."*

I blink, and find myself croching with one knee planted firmly in the ground. It is here I see, and me one again. The me of yesterday still lays defeated, wallowing in anguish at the futility of it. But here I kneel a slightly order version of he. I turn my palms upwards to see what they have become, and though bruised and battered, show signs of resilience. Courage, perservanance, the primal desire to keep going and go on. I keep going, not knowing wher eth eend desitionate lies yet. I keep going, because I know there is something waiting for me to get there. 

-----

> *"Someday, I will become someone to somebody."*

I feel a hand on my shoulder, and turn to face its owner. It is me once more, but with an older and gentler smile. I blink, and suddenly I become he. The bruises and batteries of yesterday are still present along my hand, and most have ehaled, but some have not. In this tearing of flesh, somewhere the lie was drawn. The abuse of self to was still here, but only faintly. Risks were now rishkier than before, because now there was more than myself at stake. I had people to take care of, people that look up to me, people that depend on me. I still falter, but I fail knowing that these others will always be there to catch and support me. In the sorrow i agonized in alone, I found one more truth: the journey is best with others, not in isolation.

----

> *"Today, I make the first step towards tomorrow."*

Time moves fast and slow. The me of yesteryear and the me of yesterday slow disappear, and I find myself in a hall of mirrors as deep as the eye could perceive. But these mirrors are not identical, they don't even show my reflection: but rather, show the persons I was, persons I can be, and persons I never be. It is a testament to the fourth truth, that life will change, whether we are ready or not. In our esire to be stable, we realize that stability is boring. Stability is safe, which is the riskiest action of all: to be infelxible in the wake of the unconstronable.  It is here I stand and here I lament: my yesteryear only dreamed of tomorrow, wishing to get to here and now without appreciating the journey to get here. Tomorrow finally became today, and th first truth and last tuths make themselves eeirly present: death is inevitable, and change is inevitable. My body decays as I linger in uncertainty, but the more I become uncettain, the more I realize I have so much to do. I remember th me of yesterday, not sure of where he was going, but always throttling forwards, and disvoering new horizons he could never dream of. I I feel myself getting excited once more, realizeing the journey has yet to become in th ehear around. With one deep sigh, I glance around at tthe labritny of mirrors scattered before me. The choice was here, so what do I choose? 

And without a second thought, I took the first step.
