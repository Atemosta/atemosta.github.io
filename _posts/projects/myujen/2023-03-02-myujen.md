## ...?

![Mysterious Stairwell](/images/myujen/stairwell.jpeg)


You wake up in a new place you have never been before. Slowly getting up and dusting yourself off, you begin to look around to assess where you might be. As you slowly walk up to stairwell, you try and read the text engraved into the railing. It appears to be a language that you are not familiar with - where exactly are you? As you reach the apex of the stairwell, a door appears before you. With no indication of danger or other actions to perform, you slowly open the door.

A vast darkness harkens before you, but you see a light at the end of the tunnel. More of these unusual symbols engrave the hallway towards the light. Despite your trepidation, your curiousity of the unknown compells you to move forward.

[You take the first step.][1]
