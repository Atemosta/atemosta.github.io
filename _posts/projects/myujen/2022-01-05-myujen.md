## Meet Me in the Metaverse
[The Metaverse][1] is coming, and blockchain technology is revolutionizing and expediting its arrival into our present realities. 

With NFTs becoming the iceberg to digital authentication and frictionless exchange of electronic goods, the possibilities are just surfacing to the people we will soon become. 

A small but defined reflection of yourself is how your design the spaces you habit - namely, your physical home and your virutal spaces.  

**Myujen** aims to be a simple and efficient marketplace for uploading and distributing exquisite and affordable 3D NFTs for use in decorating your virutal spaces in the blockchain universe. 

### Animal Crossing and Interior Design
[Animal Crossing: New Horizons][2] is a cute slice-of-life game developed by Nintendo where you are a nameless resident tasked with flourishing an island to live with your own style and flair. While there is no "end-game" to Animal Crossing (besides paying down your 0% interest debt), collecting colorful and cute items to create the interior rooms of your dreams is but one of the many timesinks this game provides.

While there are many programs that enable you to design interior spaces with a fraction of the effort required in Animal Crossing (trust us, it can be obnoxious to find duplicates of an item you need or moving it to just the right place in your home!), something about the journey of collecting your digital goods and being able to walk through, interact with, and host your fellow Animal Crossing friends is a unique and rewarding experience. 

## The Virtual Land Race for Empty Spaces
This section will be updated at a later point in time, but today, **2022/02/13**, there is a virtual land race for acquiring digitally scarce NFT spaces in a lousy attempt to flip the land property to the next sucker for overhyped profits. A lot of these projects have insane roadmaps with underqualified teams that will most likely not follow through on their promises, but we at Atemosta are holding our breath because after the mayhem, something beautiful and economically accessbile will come to fruition... maybe like Animal Crossing but on the blockchain?

In the meantime, [On Cyber][3] is an excellent product in which users can connect their Web3 Wallets in order to retrieve and display their collected NFTs into a gallery (or super expensive limited edition space) and really display what they are about! It's quite lovely, and the whole idea of Myujen came about not because of the artificial scarcity of NFTs, but the dorky 3D props not being sold that gave each space life.

### Your Virtual NFT Self, Today
As venomously described in the last section, the craze of obtaining and flipping low-quality NFTs that barely make use of the technology is the rampant use case as of today, and threatens to disenfranchise the entire space with the slew of scams and environmental destruction in its wake. 

We at Atemosta still see the value and potential in what blockchain technology can bring to the world despite these low-handing fruits being the focus of the market, and will focus our efforts on the development Myujen.


### Preview
[A demo of Myujen][4] can be found on the Rinkeyby testnet for testing and feedback. To log in, all one needs to do is connect their Web3 wallet which will serve as their account and unique identifier.
