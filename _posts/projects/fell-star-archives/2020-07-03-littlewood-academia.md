Despite being more populous and interconnected than ever, there has never been a more [[dystopic sense of community in the present day world. The desire to meet and befriend strangers is seen as something close to heretical, which creates an increasingly sense of isolation for those who want to grow beyond their current social circles. We at **Atemosta** want to do our part to break this [[silly [[ social strata]], and what better way to party up with strangers than with a quest?

**Littlewood Academia** is our first social experiment in cultivating the feelings of courage, comradity, and communcation, our favorite feelings created by a task as simple as taking on a guild request. How do you propose to make guilds "real", you may ask? The first thing is to make a vibrant online community based on these principles.

Serious tones aside, **Littlewood Academia** is about having fun! To start our journey, we have created a Nintendo Switch Onling Gaming Discord server that any and all are welcome to join! Why the Nintendo Switch?, you may be pondering to yourself. Nintendo has historically been a restrictive entity when it comes to their games and online experiences associated with it. Truth be told, if you don't already have friends who play on the Nintendo Switch, it is exceedinly difficult to find and befriend them on Nintendo's already difficult to use platform. By integrating with something as simple and mainstream as discord, we hope to lower the barrier of entry to find new companions in the Nintendo Switch Games you love.

## Sword/Shield Online Pokemon League
Our Online Pokemon League also deserves a HUGE shoutout! Upset with the lack of content provided by the latest Pokemon releases, we have decided to take the adventure one notch higher. Lifelong Pokemon fans regonize the intesity that comes with battling in the Gym Leader challenge all the way through the Elite Four and finally the Champion, but lament at how triiviall the battles really are when you can overwhem opponents through sheer leveling. Through our community-created Online Pokemon League, we replicate that same challenge but with players who specialize in only one type of pokemon on an even playing field. The monsters trainers we created are frustating to many a challenger, but only through the sheer collision of battling do we become stronger trainers ourselves.

The Littlewood Online Pokemon League hosts a monthly monotype tournament (Gym Leader Challenge), Pokemon League Challenge where you must beat 8 Gymm Leaders to collect their gym badges for the chance to battle the Elite Four and current Champion, and monthly no-type restriction tournament. All community created events are free to enter, and feature eShop Gift Cards to the ultimate winners of each event!
