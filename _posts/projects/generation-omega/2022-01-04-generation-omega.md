### Welcome to the Wasteland
**Omega Generation** is upcoming experimental blockchain game created in collabaration between [Atemosta][1] and [Scrimmage][2]. 

In this game, 10,000 humanoids will be spawned onto the [Polygon][3] blockchain as OG Cards using [NFT][4] technology. 

Each OG Card will have unique stats per Dungeons and Dragons mechanics, and once minted will be tasked with surviving the post-apocalypic sci-fi world they have been spawned into. 

A survival scenario will be divided into 20 stages where an OG Owner will have the ability to make a decision based on what statistic and/or supplementary skill will lead to the highest probability of success in that stage. Through skill, sharp-wits, and sheer luck, an OG will be able to survive all stages in a scenario. 

Success in a scenario will will lead to a cash prize distribution at the end of a season, the ability to name your OG based on what they did to survive the scenario, and limited edition NFTs to commerate your survival and unlock buffs for future scenarios. 

### Tokenomics
On a pre-annouced date, players can mint OG Cards to obtain the ability to participate in a scenario. 

A scenario will last 4 weeks, and in those four weeks an OG must succeed in all 20 stages in order to be eligible for the **Success Rewards**.

80% of the funds generated by minting each OG Card will be set as the prize pool for OGs that survive a scenario. 

10% of the funds will be used to pay the development team.

5% of the funds will be put into a community treasurey where DAO token holders can pick the direction of the next scenario and vote on which upcoming artists, writers, and developers to hire and collaborate on future scenarios.

### Preview
[A demo of Omega Generation][5] can be found on the Rinkeyby testnet for playtesting and feedback. Testnet ETH can be aquired [here][6].
