### What is Immria?
As explorers of the metaverse, Atemosta is always searching the next great and meaningful intersection of blockchain, fantasy, and virtual reality. In our digital traversals, we stumbled upon an experience called the [Monument of Life][1]... 

![Monument of Life Virtual Reality Display](/images/projects/immria/m3.jpeg)


and realized there is potential in engraving and displaying permanent names in the metaverse. 

Thus, we created ***Immria***.

![Immria Preview 1](/images/projects/immria/m5.jpeg)

***Immria*** is an NFT Collection by Atemosta to celebrate early supporters of our **[projects][11]** and **[stories][10]** using virtual reality and blockchain technologies.

An ***Immria*** NFT enables token owners to engrave their name into its metaverse world via the ***Immria Engraving dApp***, *coming soon...*

The first NFT collection of Immria, ***Novus***, can now be accessed via the [VR demo site][3], and a preview of the world can be viewed below.
