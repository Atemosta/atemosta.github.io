## What is Immria?
As explorers of the metaverse, Atemosta is always searching the next great and meaningful intersection of blockchain, fantasy, and virtual reality. In our digital traversals, we stumbled upon an experience called the [Monument of Life][1]...

and realized there is potential in engraving and displaying permanent names in the metaverse. 

Thus, we created ***Immria***.

***Immria*** is an NFT Collection by Atemosta to celebrate early supporters of our **[projects][11]** and **[stories][10]** using virtual reality and blockchain technologies.

An ***Immria*** NFT enables token owners to engrave their name into its metaverse world via the ***Immria Engraving dApp***, *coming soon...*

Early NFT Owners will also be eligible for exclusive discord roles, future token airdrops, future NFT allowlists, and many other utilities in our emerging metaverse.

The first NFT collection of Immria, the ***Monument of Life***, can now be accessed via the [demo site][3], and a preview of the world can be viewed below.
