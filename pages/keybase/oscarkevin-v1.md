## About
<img src="/images/me1.jpg" width="238" height="317" />

Hi! My name is **Oscar Kevin Sandoval Rivera** ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, and I like to work on software that authentically connects and deepens the bonds between current strangers and future friends. 

I currently work as a *Senior Associate Software Engineer* at **Capital One** and am looking to transition into a **full-time web3 role**.  

I also am bootstrapping **[Atemosta](https://atemosta.com/)**, a not-for-profit focused on bridging the gap between our physical and digital personas using emerging technologies, notably *XR*, *Blockchain*, and *Storytelling*.

Probably my pride and joy, a simple project I spun up in college and have slowly been improving as I learn more within and outside my job. It serves alerts to over 3,400 twitter users and 150 discord users, and has ran without major issues since 2017! Currently refactoring into a microservices architecture with complete CI/CD.
