Thank you SOOO much in your interest and investment into our works here at Atemosta! We appreciate anything you can give, ***even a single bell help!*** For those who can afford to donate above and beyond, we will memoralize your donation in our personal [hall of heroes][1].

## Donation Rewards and Levels (Optional)
If you would like to submit your donation and be recognized and receive no additional rewards, skip this section. 

If you would like to submit your donation and receive one-time rewards for helping Atemosta plant its roots, read on! 
Donations and their rewards will ONLY be available before the official release of Tempest Crossing, so if you want to be part of a new VR history, donate whatever you can, whenever you can! Once Tempest Crossing is released, no more backer rewards will be created and no more Tempest Tokens will be minted. 

### Tempest Tokens?
Tempest Tokens are a special currency which will be minted ONLY at the onset of Tempest Crossing, and will be used to redeem limited-time rewards. Tempest Tokens are burned after use, so these will get rarer over time and could be held for profit for newer players in the future...
