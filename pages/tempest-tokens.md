### Tempest Tokens?
Tempest Tokens are a special currency acquired through monetary donations and other community volunteer efforts which will be minted ONLY before the official release of [Tempest Crossing][1], and will be used to redeem limited-time rewards. Tempest Tokens are burned after use, so these will get rarer over time and could be held for profit for newer players in the future...
